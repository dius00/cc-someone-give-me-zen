# cc-someone-give-me-zen
A short procedural generated / time-attack racing game, developed with Unity and C#, while I was a student at Code Chrysalis.

Don't fall off the track or you'll lose!
Every 90 seconds the last hovercar is eliminated.
Enjoy the ride!

All required assets are included. Open with Unity, build and play.
